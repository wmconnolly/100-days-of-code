# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I've made the decision to launch into the often seen '100 days of code' challenge, with the goal of learning `Go`; a language that is relatively new to me. After choosing the book _"Go in Action"_ I've settled on the following approach to the 100 days challenge: Read the book, explore the corresponding code (locally), and document my takeaways each day. If I end up with self-written code from a particular day, I'll post that too; though that may not be a frequent outcome. Otherwise, today I've setup vim-go, read up to page 94 (that includes readings before starting the challenge), and put this repository in motion! 

**Thoughts:** What's impressing me most from Go so far is what _it lacks_, or at least what it contstrains (i.e. formatting). From my perspective this is awesome, because as a new learner I feel my ramp-up time will be relatively quicker compared to that of a looser language, where there's a 'yes, do this; but...' to seemingly every aspect of the language. The only 'batteries included' aspect I see in Go, so far, is in its concurrency considerations - I am very excited by this, and feel the work done by the authors / core team will open up a sphere of programming that would otherwise be too prohibitive for my (current) non-professional relationship to computer science. A language which effectively handles events which may or may not depend on eachother, or to happen simultaneously is just _really really_ cool; no wonder Go has emerged as foundational tool for IT infrastructure. For day 1, I'll probably take a look at Go's type system, and reproduce some notes on that.
